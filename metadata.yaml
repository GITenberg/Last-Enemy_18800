description: Part of H. Beam Piper's popular Paratime series, "Last Enemy" follows
  the work of researcher Dallona of Hadron, who is attempting to determine whether
  any aspect of the mind, body or soul survives the process of death. However, when
  her experiments suggest that sentience does outlast the physical body, and she uncovers
  a link between this immortality and time travel, Dallona is faced with unforeseen
  consequences she never expected.
